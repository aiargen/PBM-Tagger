We are facing an issue regarding the &quot;Request on behalf of&quot; functionality in DWP and we want to understand why this is happening and how can it be corrected.

Right after submitting the Service Request on behalf of a user from another company than the one making the request it immediately goes into &quot;Failed&quot; status, mentioning the error &quot;Contact should be type of Customer or Employee.&quot; We have already checked from Workflow side, all the blocks and variables seems to be in order.

We have attached the filter and process logs (in the same file) and DWPC logs for better clarity regarding what is happening.

All users would require a basic level of access with Read-Only permissions and Incident Submit.  We would like these users to be able to access both Classic Mid-Tier UI and SmartIT (which has previously caused us issues due to some customizations).

However, I now have a related requirement to be able to give all users access to only VNIPM DWP regardless of whether they already have a VNIPM Helix ITSM account or not.

Questions:

1. Is it possible to give users access to DWP only?

2. Is it possible to automate this from an external source?  I.e. to be driven by the external source via an API.</td><td>Problem:

However, after changing the prompt to accept the Date in DD/MM/YYYY format, the Service Request creation fails.

The reason is that DWP always accepts the Date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

NOTE: When we look at the Service, the Customer is seeing the Date in DD/MM/YYYY format, while when checking from the BMC end, It shows in MM/DD/YYYY

Kindly help check with the DWP R&amp;D if this is expected behavior, as the Date format in the question seems to be changing depending on the Country/Region and is not consistent.

10th July: Updated date format in COPS to Updated the Date format to DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS (24-hour) in COPS as advised by Sumeet Das however issue still persists.

Based on discussion with R&amp;D, reached out to Kalpana on Teams asking if we can get on a call. She advised to get in touch with VijayKumar Rodge.

11th July: Got on a call with VijayKumar Rodge to understand the issue as follows:

Customer has an SR called Outlook Access that has a question field called &quot;AccessDate&quot; which is in mm/dd/yyyy however this date format depends on the system settings.
In HelixGPT Manager they have modified a prompt for v2 (Active) where the date format should be DD/MM/YYYY however when they submit the request using HelixGPT, it fails with error: Your request is submitted and processed. Here&#39;s the status: COMPLETED result: Error.

The date conversion is not working. Customer should see it in DD/MM/YYYY format. The one that is going in payload is yyyy/dd/mm

Updated the Date format to DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS (24-hour) in COPS as advised by Sumeet Das.
Customer has tried changing the prompt in IS&gt;&gt;HelixGPT Manager&gt;&gt;For v2 )Active). Earlier it was yyyy/dd/mm which is what is getting pulled in Network Paylod (Dev tools)

Took screenshots of the issue and escalated to R&amp;D.

We are facing the following problem, that is happening only in our client?s DEV environment. The attached DWP Service called ?Nuova Change Request? has a very simple workflow:
?	Approval to a specific user;
?	Change Request creation.
Once submitted, the DWP request immediately reaches the ?In Progress? state instead of the ?Approval? state. After a lot of time (more or less 20 minutes), the approver sees the request in his DWP.

(see attachment 1)

 If he tries to approve, nothing changes. More precisely:
?	We cannot find the DWP request in Helix ITSM;
?	We do not see any Change Request getting created;
?	System is not throwing any error.

(see attachment 2)

We expect instead that the request stays on ?Approval? state and after the approval of the user, we expect the Change to be created (this is correctly happening in another instance of another client).
For any answer, please involve also patrick.caprioli@alten.it, alessandro.vitagliano@alten.it and andrea.polverino@alten.it .

Today we created a diffusion by customer request, after a few hours the customer requested to remove it.

Therefore we removed it, however it still appears in the DWP portal.

We request to remove it, as it is possible that it is not synchronized at some point.

Greetings,
Iván Hernández</td><td>Problem:

We are encountering the attached error when trying to log in to the Digital Workplace. Sometimes users receive the error twice before successfully logging in, sometimes they log in on the first attempt, and occasionally it takes four errors before they can log in. Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?</td><td>Problem:

As shown in the screenshot, users create certain comments on DWP interactions. We want to know whether it´s possible that, instead of showing the user´s username that created it, maybe we could show the Default Support Group name to which they are assigned, or some other general field, instead of the name (we want to keep it private).

Is this possible? If so, how can we change it?

Thank you.</td><td>Problem: Comments on DWP showing username
